# EEG_network

As the increasing popularity and decreasing cost of EEG
based devices, automated analysis of EEG data is currently
in the stage of seeking higher accuracy predicting userâ€™s
brain activities. This leads to one of the sub problem that
classify brain activities based on EEG raw data. 

We have applied multi-method in order to classify the
given 4 labels, given the results of at least above 55% test
accuracy on all networks we present in this paper, and the
highest test accuracy is 68.5% using stack CNN with RNN.
